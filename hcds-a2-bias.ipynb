    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias through data on Wikipedia articles - specifically, articles on political figures from a variety of countries. Wikipedia articles and country populations datasets are combined, and ORES is used to estimate the quality of each article by country.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains step-by-step analysis, from data aquisition to results, of how the coverage of politicians on Wikipedia and the quality of articles about politicians varies between countries.The 'Results' section of this notebook contains tables that display:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the countries with the greatest and least coverage of politicians on Wikipedia compared to their population.\n",
    "2. the countries with the highest and lowest proportion of high quality articles about politicians.\n",
    "3. a ranking of geographic regions by articles-per-person and proportion of high quality articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 'Reflection' section contains a short reflection on the project that focuses on how both findings from this analysis and the process we went through to reach the findings, helped me to understand the causes and consequences of biased data in large, complex data science projects.\n"
