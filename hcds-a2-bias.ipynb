    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias through data on Wikipedia articles - specifically, articles on political figures from a variety of countries. Wikipedia articles and country populations datasets are combined, and ORES is used to estimate the quality of each article by country.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains step-by-step analysis, from data aquisition to results, of how the coverage of politicians on Wikipedia and the quality of articles about politicians varies between countries.The 'Results' section of this notebook contains tables that display:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the countries with the greatest and least coverage of politicians on Wikipedia compared to their population.\n",
    "2. the countries with the highest and lowest proportion of high quality articles about politicians.\n",
    "3. a ranking of geographic regions by articles-per-person and proportion of high quality articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 'Reflection' section contains a short reflection on the project that focuses on how both findings from this analysis and the process we went through to reach the findings, helped me to understand the causes and consequences of biased data in large, complex data science projects.\n"

    "I expected the top 10 countries by the number of articles to the population to contain several larger more popular countries, such as the United States, China, and Russia. The reasoning for is expectation, is that in my experience, the larger populated countries tend to disproportionately populate international news sources and be more well known, and consequently, politicians in these larger countries, tend to be more famous. The larger the following of a politician, the more thorough their Wikipedia article I would expect to be, and the more populated a country is, the more politician articles they will likely have. The results in fact included only small countries in terms of population ( < 400,000 ). This is possibly indicative of strong bias that I had towards the more I hear about a country, the large I expected everything to be, including politician's Wikipedia articles. In retrospect, the results do make sense as this is likely due to the low population allowing the total number of articles to have more weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the above arguement, I expected to find a heavy bias in the proportion of good to total politician Wikipedia articles, that more popular countries will have a better proportion. I found that countries that had the best proportion of good to total, were countries that are fairly popular, but have small populations, such as North and South Korea, Romania, and the Central African Republic. Several countries also were found to have no good articles, and this consisted of mostly small third world countries that are not very popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible issue with this analysis, is that a larger population does not imply that there is a larger number of politicians, and the ratio is dipropionate when looking at coverage. This raises some questions about the accurate comparisons with the analysis performed above, because we are not standardizing for the population size. For example, the United States and Aruba might have close to the same number of politician articles, but have a several magnitude difference in population, therefore Aruba would rank far higher. Thus, I would expect that the coverage will be fairly constant for most countries, but looking at the proportion of articles to population, heavily skews this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential issue for consideration, is that we are only analyzing articles written in English, and thus there may be some heavy bias about the number of articles for English speaking countries. It would be interesting to redo this analysis but using each country’s native language to count the number of Wikipedia articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further analysis, I am curious to explore the opposite end of the Wikipedia article spectrum, and analyze how countries compare based on the number of poor articles, and how the article quality varies by country. \n"
